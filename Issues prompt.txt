So I am having major issues in the pdf viewer/annotations. 

These issues range from only being able to highlight on the first page, having to reclick the highlight button after highlighting once. 

Many more. FIX THESE ISSUES AT THE MOMENT. I have tried many ways to fix this but to no luck. In an earlier version of this code which I no longer have, when I was able to highlight on multiple pages, and would highlight on lets say the 5th page of the pdf, I would be pushed back to first page, unable to scroll out of the first page.

DEEPLY THINK ABOUT THESE ISSUES, THEN RETHINK, the FUNDAMENTALLY REDESIGN THE IDEA AND REBUILD. THE ISSUE COULD BE ANYWHERE, In the PDFViewer, ANNOTATION, NOTES, PDF.JS, REACT, REACTPDF; ANYWHERE!
